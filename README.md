TM470 Project

This is the private repository for Adam Poole's TM470 Project - ScoreBoard.

ScoreBoard is an Android app for tracking competitive board game scores and statistics.
Users can store details on their board game group, members and games played, and from this
have monthly scores and overall skill ratings calculated. They can then see and compare
these stats across the group to see who is most skilled at what category of game, or
who has won the most difficult games this month and has the highest score overall.

A modified Elo's skill rating system is used to calculate rough skill ratings for games
with more than 2 teams of players.

All details are stored locally on a user's phone.
