# ScoreBoard

ScoreBoard is an Android app for board gaming groups. ScoreBoard can be used to record group members and the games played and their outcomes.
From these games played competitive statistics in the form of monthly scores and overall skill ratings are produced which can then be viewed
and compared. The goal of ScoreBoard is to provide a free app that can be used to keep a record of games played in gaming groups and promote
an environment of healthy, friendly competitive for those groups that want such an environment. This was developed as a final year university
project and, while the application works and provides the desired outcomes, there are currently no plans to release it on the app store.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository: https://github.com/wokka112/TM470_Scoreboard.

Use any IDE of your choice to start viewing and editing files. 
Android Studio is an easy to use free IDE for Android development produced by Google that you can use.

### Prerequisites

None.

## Deployment

Currently the best way to deploy the app to an Android device is to connect the device to a computer and Run the application via an IDE or
command line on said device. This will install the application. 

There is some example data available in the AppDatabase class located in the source files at
app/src/main/java/com/floatingpanda/scoreboard/data. The example data is commented out on lines 128 - 943. These lines are example data
that fill the application with groups, members, games and some statistics. If you want to use this example data to see how the app can
be used uncomment line 115 and lines 128 - 943 before installing the application.
