/**
 * Represents a group member's skill rating in that group for a particular board game category. The
 * category the rating is for is stored in the bg_categories table (BgCategory class) and linked via
 * the categoryId attribute, which is a foreign key to the bg_categories table. The group the rating
 * is for is stored in the groups table (Group class) and linked via the groupId attribute, which is
 * a foreign key to the groups table.
 *
 * Skill ratings are represented by doubles and calculated using a variant of Elo's rating system.
