/**
 * Takes a list of teams of players (TeamOfPlayer objects) and from this displays a list of players
 * for cooperative and solitaire games. This list also shows whether the players won or lost the
 * game. This is used to get confirmation of players and whether the game was won or lost when
 * creating game records.
 *
 * The following precondition exists because it is simpler where this adapter is used to keep
 * playerTeams as a list rather than extract a single playerTeam and plug it into the adapter.
 *
 * Precondition: list of TeamOfPlayer objects should only hold 1 TeamOfPlayer objects, no more or
 * less.
