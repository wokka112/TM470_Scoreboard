/**
 * Recyclerview adapter that takes a list of player teams with players and displays the teams of
 * players in a list format for cooperative and solitaire games, including whether the players won
 * or lost the game.

 * The following precondition exists because it is simpler where this adapter is used to keep
 * playerTeams as a list rather than extract a single playerTeam and plug it into the adapter.
 *
 * Precondition: list of PlayerTeamWithPlayer objects should only hold 1 TeamOfPlayer objects, no
 * more or less.
